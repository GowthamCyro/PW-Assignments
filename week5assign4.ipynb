    "Multiprocessing in Python refers to the ability of a program to create and manage multiple processes simultaneously. A process is an instance of a program that runs independently and has its own memory space. Multiprocessing allows for parallel execution of tasks by utilizing multiple processors or cores. It is useful for computationally intensive tasks that can be divided into smaller parts and processed concurrently, thereby improving overall performance and utilizing available hardware resources efficiently."

    "The main differences between multiprocessing and multithreading are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory: Each process in multiprocessing has its own separate memory space, while threads in multithreading share the same memory space within a process.\n",
    "\n",
    "CPU utilization: Multiprocessing can utilize multiple processors or cores effectively by running processes in parallel, whereas multithreading is limited by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python, which allows only one thread to execute at a time, preventing true parallelism on CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Communication: Processes in multiprocessing communicate using inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms such as pipes, queues, or shared memory. Threads in multithreading can communicate by directly accessing shared variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: Multiprocessing introduces more overhead due to the need for inter-process communication, synchronization mechanisms, and data sharing. Multithreading has less overhead but requires careful synchronization to avoid race conditions."
