    "Primary Key: A primary key is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It enforces entity integrity and ensures that each row has a unique identifier. A primary key constraint is applied to the column(s) to enforce this uniqueness. Typically, primary keys are used to identify and retrieve individual records efficiently. For example, in a table representing employees, an \"employee_id\" column can be designated as the primary key.\n",

    "Foreign Key: A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a relationship between two tables based on the values in those columns. Foreign keys enable referential integrity and maintain data consistency between related tables. For example, if there is an \"employee_id\" column in an \"orders\" table that references the \"employee_id\" column in the \"employees\" table, it creates a foreign key relationship. This relationship ensures that an order can only be associated with an existing employee."
